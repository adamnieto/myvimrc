# Setting up your .vimrc file

1. Make sure you install Vundle. You can do that by executing the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim```

2. Copy over the directory `bundle` in this repository to your `~/.vim/` directory.

3. Add the .vimrc file in this repository to your root directory.

4. After you add it, execute the following command `vim +PluginInstall +qall`. You can also just go into vim and do `esc` then `:PluginInstall`. Press enter.

5. Done!
